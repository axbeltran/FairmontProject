				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> <img src="fairmonthouse.png" alt="">
					Fairmont is a small, urban, unicorporated neighborhood
					located between Lockport and Joliet in Will County, Illinois. The region where
					Fairmont was initially settled can be dated back far to the 1870's, with the population
					during that time consisting of Eastern European and Irish immigrants who moved to
					Illinois to work on the Illinois & Michigan Canal, the Rock Island Railroad, and the
					Illinois Ship and Sanitary Canal. By the 1950's, Fairmont grew into a stable neighborhood,
					mainly due to the large influx of African Americans moving to northern states after WW2.

					Currently, Fairmont facing a change to its population, with a growing number of Hispanic residents
					moving into the neighborhood. A neighborhood plan called the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for
					Planning (CMAP) is currently in effect to help the future of Fairmont grow into a stronger tomorrow.
					Detailed below is the history of how this strong neighborhood grew into a great community.
				</p>

				<h1 style="color: #828f21">Early Migration - Late 1800's to Early 1900's</h1>

				<p> <img style="height: 320px;" src="fairmontoverhead.png" alt="image">
					As far as we know, the earliest resident of Fairmont was a man
					by the name of Isaac Nobes, an English immigrant who owned the Oak Hill Quarry in Joliet in
					1873 and built his home on what is now named Nobes Avenue and Illinois Route 171. The Nobes
					Mansion was a beautifully crafted building that reflected the architectual influence of the
					original immigrants who lived there. However, over time this great monument was torn down after
					it became too much work to keep up, and because it was too large or expensive for another family
					to purchase, it was demolished. This is one of the few glimpses we have into Fairmonts past as
					there
					is no documented history on the early years of Fairmont prior to 1940.
				</p>


				<h3>Major Industries Attract Immigration</h3>
				<p>
					What drew many people to this location than anywhere else was the availability of work.
					Major industrial opportunities were available for immigrants to take up, ranging from canal
					construction,
					cemetary construction, and also railroad construction.
				</p>

				<h3>Illinois & Michigan Canal (1836-1848)</h3>
				<p>
					The I&M Canal currently runs for 96 miles from Chicago to La Salle, Illinois and its
					construction
					attracted a large number of Irish, German, and Swedish immigrants to assist in its
					construction. The construction
					encouraged the growth of Joliet and surrounding areas when limestone was discovered, thus
					giving Joliet the name
					"City of Stone". This growth continued until Indiana's limestone was discovered to be
					superior, reducing Joliet's
					limestone output and total number of jobs. However, the I&M Canal served Joliet greatly,
					serving as the most significant
					aspect to the growth of the manufacturing industry for Joliet.
				</p>

				<h3>Russian Grove Cemetary (Early 1900's - Present)</h3>
				<p>
					The Russian Grove Cemetary sits on the northern side of A.F. Hill Park and was originally
					used for picnics by the members of the St. Nicholas Orthodox Church which used to be located in
					Fairmont. Today the cemetary does not appear to be frequented, and the upkeep is minimal. Yet,
					Russian, Greek, and Serbian. There are still grave markers today in the cemetary with Eastern
					European characters to denote the placement of graves.
				</p>

				<h3>Rock Island Railroad (1852 - Present)</h3>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;" ;>
					The Rock Island Railroad established in 1852 in Joliet worked in conjunction with the Joliet
					Steel Mill to transport goods
					throughout the region. Today, Metra currently uses the train lines for commuter trains to
					Chicago.
				</p>

				<h1 style="color: #828f21">Second Wave of Migration - 1950's through 1980's</h1>
				<p>
					In the second wave of migration, Fairmont saw an increase of African American migrants moving from
					the south for the booming industry and wide range of available jobs found in Joliet at the time.
					Many residents described Fairmont as country living in the city, and chose
					to live in an unicorporated neighborhood for its rural charm, and cheap land prices. Residents of
					different ethnic backgrounds lived on the same block harmoniously, although there was some racial
					division at the thime, such as Oak Street, which historically has been a dividing line between White
					and African American homeowners.
				</p>

				<h3>The Hill</h3>
				<p>
					"The Hill" is a cultural reference to a section of Fairmont and Forest Park where the majority
					of
					the African American residents lived.
					To outsiders "The Hill" may have just been known as Riley's Hill, a street with an incline that
					passes through the southern end of Fairmont. "The Hill"
					bares great significane and was indicative of the outside reception of Fairmont. While residents
					spoke of the neighborhood being racially integrated in the
					1960's, interviews revealed that White residents lived North of Oak Street, and African American
					residents to the South.
				</p>


				<p> <img src="thehill.png" alt="image">
					Currently "The Hill" is still a stigma
					that has been placed on Fairmont and Joliet. Anyone not from "The Hill" would consider it to be
					a
					dangerous area with a high concentration of poverty. While elements
					of this may be true, the crime does not appear to be coming from Fairmont itself, but from
					outside.
					The problems this neighborhood is facing are similar to that of
					any predominately low income neighborhoods in the country right now. A look into the actual
					neighborhood will reveal a number of hard working families with a strong
					commitment to a neighborhood that once thrived, and due to economic disinvestment is currently
					struggling.
				</p>


				<h3>Segregation or Integration?</h3>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;" ;>
					The Fairmont neighborhood in the 1950's and 1960's was comprised of African American and Eastern
					European immigrants. In the 1970's the White
					population declined substantially, but not due to "white flight". Interviews with previous residents
					of Eastern European descent revealed positive memories of Fairmont
					as a place where people of different ethnicities lived harmoniously side by side. The out-migration
					of white residents can be attributed to the aging population needing
					different types of housing that Fairmont did not off at the time, including larger homes to raise a
					family or senior housing. Fairmont did not lose all of its White Eastern
					European population. North of Oak Street has many larger homes where long term residents have
					remained. Fairmont, South of Oak Street, does not have a varied housing stock.
					The majority of homes are what today's standards would consider 'starter homes' built inn the
					1960's. The combination small square footage and size, the homes were likely
					not suitable for the second generation of Fairmont residents: people whose families immigrated
					there, were born in the neighborhood and raised there. Many of them reside in
					nearby areas, but have since left Fairmont with a fond memory of it.
				</p>

				<h1 style="color: #828f21">Third Wave of Migration - 1980's to Present</h1>
				<h3>Well Capping in 1996/1997</h3>
				<p>
					The majority of Fairmont homes were on private wells until 1996 when a joint project was taken on
					between the Will County Department of Health and Lockport
					Township. This project identified about 150 cross connected wells in the neighborhood. This meant
					private wells were still being used in conjunction with the Lockport Township
					wells, which posed a risk of cross contamination if the private wells were to get contaminated. This
					was a particular threat because Fairmont has a lot of vacant lots and dumping
					became a problem. This dumping could potentially contaminate the abandoned wells, thus contaminating
					the entire water system. Representatives went door to door to attempt to
					convince residents to close their private wells. Since a private well is essentially free water,
					many were not interested in participating and only 1/3 of the wells were closed.
					Additionally the Lockport Township Water Department does not have the authority to close the wells
					without consent, therefore, many were left open.
					This became a serious problem when the Lockport Township Water Department had two community wells
					that were contaminated, presumably due to cross contamination. There was a concern
					that abandoned wells on vacant properties were being used as sewers. Currently the cross
					contamination of wells in Fairmont is still a concern, as it is very expensive
					to decontaminate the water system.
				</p>

				<h3>Call to Action</h3>

				<p> <img src="fairmontschool.png" alt="image">
					The Fairmont Community has been undergoing an increase of community activism, and a few projects
					are
					underway due to a partnership between the Will County
					Land Use Department and the Fairmont Community Partnership. In 2008 a planning process began
					with
					the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) in which the Land Use
					Department applied for a Local Technical Assistance Grant. This grant allowed the Land Use
					Department to get the assistance of a planner from CMAP to put together a neighborhood
					plan for Fairmont that plans for the future growth of the community. The plan was put together
					with
					the help of Fairmont residents and community leaders through a series of workshops
					to identify the wants and needs of the residents.
				</p>



				<p>
					To date, some projects have been completed. CMAP has completed the visioning process which
					resulted
					in the neighborhood plan, as well as using Fairmont as a study area showing how
					infrastructure improvements can have a positive effect on the community for the Future Leaders
					in
					Planning Program (FLIP). A “safe routes to school” grant has been secured to
					allow for the construction of a segment of sidewalk leading to the Fairmont School, and a
					community
					garden has been started next to the Fairmont Community Center.
